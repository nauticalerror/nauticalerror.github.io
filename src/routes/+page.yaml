    hello! welcome to my corner of the internet!


    i'm flo. i created this site as a digital scrapbook to host and share bits of internet things i find interesting--music, links, blogs, thoughts, 


    what else?
    i currently exist somewhere in massachusetts, usa, but i was germinated in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogor">rainy city</a> in indonesia.


    this site will probably always be under construction but is currently under MAJOR construction. a perpetual big dig, if you will.
